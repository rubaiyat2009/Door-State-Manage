# Door State Machine This project implements a simple state machine for controlling a door that can be either open or closed. The state machine transitions between states based on events. ## Features - Initial state is 'Closed'. - Handles `open` and `close` events to transition between states. - Provides the current state of the door. ## Getting Started These instructions will help you set up the project and run it on your local machine. ### Prerequisites - Python 3.x ### Installing 1. Clone the repository: ```sh git clone https://github.com/yourusername/door-state-machine.git cd door-state-machine ``` 2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment: ```sh python -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate` ``` 3. Install any dependencies (if applicable): ```sh pip install -r requirements.txt ``` ## Usage You can use the DoorStateMachine class to simulate door operations. ### Example ```python from door_state_machine import DoorController door = DoorController() print(f'Initial Status: {door.get_status()}') # Outputs: Closed door.handle_event('open') print(f'Status after "open" event: {door.get_status()}') # Outputs: Open door.handle_event('close') print(f'Status after "close" event: {door.get_status()}') # Outputs: Closed ``` ## Contributing Please feel free to submit issues and pull requests for any improvements or bug fixes. ## License This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details. ## Acknowledgments - Inspiration from state machine examples and event-driven programming concepts.
